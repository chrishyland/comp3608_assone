	# Need to define minmax algorithm

	# Take the depth factor so we know how much of the tree we should traverse.
	# DFS and evaluate. 
		# At the leaves, check the utility of the move through evaluation functions.
		# Return the highest value and which one to traverse
	# Choose the min, max etc
	# Traverse the path
	# Need to check has the game ended or not as well
